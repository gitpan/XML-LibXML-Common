XML::LibXML::Common version 0.10
================================

XML::LibXML::Common contains several constants and functions that
are shared by XML::LibXML, XML::GDOME and XML::LibXSLT (not all done, yet)

This package is required at least for XML::LibXML 1.53 or later to 
work properly.

the latest cvs can be found at sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-xml
