XML::LibXML::Common 
===================

XML::LibXML::Common contains several constants and functions that
are shared by XML::LibXML, XML::GDOME and XML::LibXSLT (not all done, yet)

This package is required at least for XML::LibXML 1.53 or later to 
work properly.

The latest cvs can be found at sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-xml

For requests please contact me by e-mail. I try to answer my e-mails
on a regular basis. But since I am offline from time to time it may take
up to a week before I will be able to answer.
